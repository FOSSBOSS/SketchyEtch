well, Im not even sure how this will work, but im going to try making a sketchy etch version that can write openscad files.

I'd tested the concept a few days ago. The basic method is to use python to write the scad code, and pyautogui to send the F5 command to openscad
so that the image renders.
Openscad is pretty jank, but its the simplest avenue I know of.
