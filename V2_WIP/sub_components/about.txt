Givent the overwhelming popularity of this prject, and my aquisition of additonal materials, and new expiramentable desgings,
this prject is going to see a version 2! Very exciting I know!

We are going to take the work from HDMI2C, and expand it to this project.
That means putting rotary encoders into the HMDI I2C bus, and processing inputs. 

Some other feature ideas:
More colors!
change pen size
dynamic acceleration to speed up drawing large images. 
new hardware implementation, that remains cross platform compatatble, and distro agnostic.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I just realized a perk to the new encoders having memory of thier last, (present?) location!
It means I can turn the scan rate way down, and keep bandwitch low, while not needing
to mess with IRQs and counters.
