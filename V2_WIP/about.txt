Givent the overwhelming popularity of this prject, and my aquisition of additonal materials, and new expiramentable desgings,
this prject is going to see a version 2! Very exciting I know!

We are going to take the work from HDMI2C, and expand it to this project.
That means putting rotary encoders into the HMDI I2C bus, and processing inputs. 

Some other feature ideas:
background color change.
vectors
a GUI config file
size and shape variants of the pen
more colours
acceleration to speed up drawing large images.
