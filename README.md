<br>
Sketch-Y-Etch is a retrospective etch-a-sketch-esque drawing expirience with a modern twist.<br>
The Sketch-Y-Etch project is undergoing a major revission, in a exploration of new and novel methods.<br>
This is educational project if you want it to be, and just plain fun if you just want to do some drawing.


<b>version 1:</b><br>
The project is housed in a 43 inch TV, with the addition of 2 rotary encoders, 4 buttons providing keystokes using an microcontroler.<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
focuses even more on being platform agnostic, requiring only an HMDI port, or a keyboard. Linux, Mac, or windows, Sketch-Y-etch is designed to run on ANYTHING.<br>
<br>Embeding this prject in a TV is fun, but not required. The Sketch-Y-Etch project is highly flexible, and OPEN to many types of installations.<br>
<br>You want a 72" Sketch-Y-Etch? do it! Embed it into a projector with a raspberry pi? You can do it! want to just open it up and run on your PC? Not a problem.<br>
<br>We are very interested to see what you create. Need some help making your own? better documentation is on the way, and I'm here to help.<br>
If you are in the greater Bangor Maine area, feel free to come to the Bangor Makerspace to check the sketch-y-etch out in person!
