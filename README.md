Sketch-Y-Etch is a retrospective etch-a-sketch-esque drawing expirience with a modern twist.
The project is housed in a 43 inch TV, with the addition of 2 rotary encoders, 4 buttons and 1 switch.
Use the switch to enter demo mode, where your propaganda can be displayed. 
Button features include: Save, penup / pendown, colour change, and erase.
Rotary encoders are used to perform XY cordinate based drawing. 

Built on a Raspberry Pi 4B.
